# Framework and Technologies 
We have used various tools, technologies, and frameworks for the implementation. In the 
beginning of the project, we analysed and compared different programming languages, 
collaboration tools and IDEs which would help us with the implementation provide robust code 
environment and flexibility of creating custom data structures. Below is the final list of 
frameworks and technologies selected to design a distributed database management system. 
### Coding Language: React.js for front-end, Python/JavaScript for cloud/lambda function 
We have used JavaScript as our programming language for the project. JavaScript is a 
core language and provides support for all dynamic data structures, thus provided us 
flexibility to refer to various data structures.  
### Serverless Technology used: AWS and Google Cloud services 
In the project, cloud services such as lambda function, s3, API gateway, DynamoDB were 
used. To deploy google cloud run, was used. To visualize data, google data studio was 
used.

### Project Version Control Tool: GitLab 
We used GitLab as a version control tool where we all collaborated and pushed our code 
to develop using feature-branches. Each member took care of their modules and pushed 
code in the feature branch after doing unit testing. After all the tests were passed, code 
was finally merged with main. 
### OS supported: Windows 10, MacOS, Linux 
The prerequisite of using our code is the system must require JDK to operate the java 
program. Additionally, plugins must be installed for Gradle project, which is necessary 
when running the program on terminal. 
### Application type: Web Application 
We created a console application and offered various options to the user to verify 
implementation of a database management system. 
### Project Architecture Design: Draw.io 
We used draw.io for creating flowcharts and sequence diagrams.  
### IDE: VS Code 
We used VS Code as the IDE as it offers various plugins so that we adhere to clean code 
standards and debug our application in case of failures.
